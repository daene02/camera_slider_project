# Active Context - Last Updated: 06/02/2025 4:53am

## Current Work Status
- Completed comprehensive code review of camera integration system
- Identified key areas for optimization and improvement
- Added support for Canon EOS R50 camera
- Implemented live view and recording functionality

## Recent Changes
1. Camera Integration Review:
   - Analyzed gphoto2 implementation for Canon EOS R50
   - Reviewed error handling and retry mechanisms
   - Evaluated live view and recording features

2. System Analysis:
   - Identified performance bottlenecks in live view streaming
   - Found potential race conditions in profile playback
   - Discovered areas for motor control optimization

## Next Steps

### High Priority
1. Camera Improvements:
   - Implement camera settings caching
   - Add connection pooling
   - Develop auto-reconnect functionality
   - Enhance error recovery for camera busy states

2. Performance Optimization:
   - Convert live view to MJPEG streaming
   - Implement event-based motor position monitoring
   - Add proper connection pooling
   - Refactor asynchronous operations

### Medium Priority
1. Motion Control:
   - Add acceleration curves
   - Implement motion interpolation
   - Add motor stall detection

2. Focus System:
   - Develop auto-focus capabilities
   - Implement focus stacking
   - Add focus calibration
   - Add predictive focus tracking

### Low Priority
1. Code Structure:
   - Unify error handling system
   - Implement dependency injection
   - Enhance logging system

## Current Issues
- Mixed sync/async code patterns
- Polling-based motor position verification
- Basic motion profiles could be more sophisticated
- Live view performance could be improved
- Limited error recovery in some areas

## Technical Decisions Pending
1. Best approach for MJPEG streaming implementation
2. Strategy for camera connection pooling
3. Method for motor position event system
4. Architecture for unified error handling
