# Camera Slider Project - Active Context

## Current Task
Improving web interface consistency and implementing missing features for comprehensive motion and focus control.

## Technical Requirements
1. Motion Profile System (Priority)
   - Standard velocity parameter for all motors except pan/tilt
   - Fixed acceleration values per motor type
   - Velocity storage per focus point
   - Pan/tilt angles auto-calculated from focus points

2. Web Interface Consistency
   - Unified design system
   - Consistent component styling
   - Standardized layout patterns

3. Focus System Enhancement
   - Multiple focus point storage
   - Focus point integration with motion profiles
   - Variable focus point sequencing with velocity control

## Recent Changes
- Identified web interface inconsistencies
- Analyzed missing motion control features
- Evaluated focus point management requirements

## Next Steps
1. Design unified web interface system
2. Implement profile management system
   - Motion profiles (velocity/acceleration)
   - Focus point profiles
   - Integration between motion and focus

3. Develop multi-focus point system
   - Storage mechanism
   - Profile integration
   - Sequence management

## Current Status
Planning phase - Preparing for comprehensive web interface enhancement
