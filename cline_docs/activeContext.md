# Active Context: Time-Based Motion Profile Implementation

## Recent Implementation (03 March 2025)
1. **Drive Mode Update**
   - Implemented Time-based Profile as drive mode (mode 4)
   - Retained original velocity and acceleration values
   - Improved motion smoothness and predictability

2. **Position Check Mechanism**
   - New velocity-based position verification
   - Simple threshold check: velocity â‰¤ 0.2
   - More responsive and accurate movement tracking
   - Replaces old position tolerance checking

3. **Motion Control Strategy**
   - Primary Motors:
     * Maintains original velocity values
     * Uses profile-based acceleration
     * Time-based movement profiles
   - Pan/Tilt Motors:
     * Fixed velocity (20) and acceleration (20)
     * Dedicated position tracking

## Key Parameters
- Drive Mode: Time-based Profile (mode 4)
- Velocity Threshold: 0.2
- Position Check Interval: 0.05 seconds
- Position Check Timeout: 30 seconds

## Next Steps
1. Monitor real-world performance
2. Fine-tune velocity threshold if needed
3. Add performance logging
4. Test various movement scenarios
5. Document movement characteristics
