# Active Development Context

## Recent Changes (Last 24 Hours)

### Axis Visualization System
- Implemented clickable position numbers along Y-axis
- Added interactive hover effects (50% size increase)
- Added green glow effect for selected values
- Proper mm to motor step conversion (64 steps/mm)
- Adaptive text sizing based on zoom level
- Interactive movement control via number clicks

### Focus System Improvements

- Enhanced tracking smoothness with 50Hz updates
- Improved position feedback during tracking

### Components Updated

1. AxisRenderer
   - Added clickable area tracking
   - Implemented hover detection
   - Added visual feedback systems
   - Improved text rendering with effects

2. CanvasManager
   - Added click/hover event handling
   - Implemented position conversion logic
   - Enhanced cursor feedback
   - Added mm to motor step conversion

3. Focus System
   - Added angle corrections
   - Improved tracking stability
   - Enhanced position accuracy

4. Profile System
   - Added continuous tracking updates
   - Improved error handling
   - Enhanced logging for diagnostics

### Known Issues
1. Visualization
   - Need to monitor hover detection accuracy at different zoom levels
   - May need to optimize redraw frequency for hover effects

2. Focus System
   - Still testing angle correction accuracy
   - Need to verify tracking stability under rapid movement

### Improvements Needed
1. User Interface
   - Consider adding visual feedback for motor movement
   - May add hover tooltips for position values
   - Could add keyboard shortcuts for position control

2. Performance
   - Monitor tracking update rate impact
   - Consider optimizing redraw calls
   - May need to batch position updates

3. Error Handling
   - Add user feedback for motor errors
   - Improve position validation
   - Add recovery mechanisms for tracking interruptions

### Next Steps
1. Validation & Testing
   - Verify angle corrections across full range
   - Test tracking stability at different speeds
   - Validate position accuracy at boundaries

2. Potential Enhancements
   - Add position presets
   - Consider adding acceleration control
   - May add movement path visualization

3. Documentation
   - Update user guide with new features
   - Add technical documentation for motor control
   - Document coordinate system changes

### Current Status
- Focus visualization system working with improved interaction
- Position control system fully functional
- Tracking system operates with corrected angles
- Enhanced user feedback system in place

### Technical Notes
- Motor step ratio: 64 steps/mm
- Update frequency: 50Hz for tracking
