# Active Context: Motor Conversion and Offset Refinement

## Current Focus
Refining motor step-to-unit conversions for:
- Slider (mm conversion)
- Pan/Tilt (degree conversion)
- Correcting motor offsets

## Immediate Tasks
1. Review current conversion factors in motor_controller.py
2. Validate step-to-unit calculations
3. Determine precise motor offsets
4. Update conversion methods
5. Test and calibrate motor movements

## Potential Challenges
- Ensuring accurate physical positioning
- Handling different motor mounting orientations
- Maintaining consistency across different motor types

## Next Steps
- Perform detailed motor movement tests
- Adjust conversion factors
- Update playback and profile mechanisms
