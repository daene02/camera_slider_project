# Camera Slider Project - Product Context

## Purpose
This project is a motorized camera slider system that allows for precise camera movements while maintaining focus on a specific subject. The system is designed to create professional-looking video shots by combining linear motion with automated focus tracking.

## Core Problems Solved
1. Maintaining consistent focus during camera movement
2. Coordinating multiple motors (slider, pan, tilt, focus) simultaneously
3. Calculating precise angles and focus adjustments based on subject position
4. Providing an intuitive, responsive user interface for control

## How It Works
1. The camera moves along a linear slider track (Y-axis movement)
2. The system automatically adjusts:
   - Pan angle (horizontal rotation)
   - Tilt angle (vertical rotation) 
   - Focus distance
3. All adjustments are calculated to keep the subject (at X400 Y600 Z-300) in sharp focus
4. The motion system uses coordinated motor control for smooth movements
5. The web interface provides real-time control and monitoring
