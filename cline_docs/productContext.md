# Camera Slider Project - Product Context

## Purpose
This project is a motorized camera slider system that allows for precise camera movements while maintaining focus on a specific subject. The system is designed to create professional-looking video shots by combining linear motion with automated focus tracking.

## Core Problems Solved
1. Maintaining consistent focus during camera movement
2. Coordinating multiple motors (slider, pan, tilt, focus) simultaneously
3. Calculating precise angles and focus adjustments based on subject position

## How It Works
1. The camera moves along a linear slider track (Y-axis movement)
2. The system automatically adjusts:
   - Pan angle (horizontal rotation)
   - Tilt angle (vertical rotation) 
   - Focus distance
3. All adjustments are calculated to keep the subject (at X400 Y600 Z-300) in sharp focus
4. The motion system uses coordinated motor control for smooth movements

## Key Features
- Real-time focus tracking
- Multi-axis motor coordination
- Position-based focus calculation
- Smooth motion control
